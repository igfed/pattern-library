# pattern-library
Here is a getting started guide.
This project uses NPM and node.js to help us automate some of our tasks and reducce the complexity of the overall project.
Before proceeding please install them both.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/igfed/pattern-library
cd pattern-library
# Install the project's dependencies
npm install
# If you dont have bower installed now is the time to do that.
npm install -g bower
# Then add your dependancies
bower install

# Run the project locally
gulp serve

# Build the project for distrobution
gulp build
```
