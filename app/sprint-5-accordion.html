                    We make reasonable efforts to locate and notify owners of unclaimed accounts, based in part on the value of the account. In some cases we may ask Canada Revenue Agency (CRA)

                    If you are an executor for an estate or have power of attorney for someone that you suspect may have an unclaimed account, we will ask you to include evidence of your authority

                    In creating our policies for unclaimed accounts, we have followed regulations for "Unclaimed Property" that have been enacted in Alberta, British Columbia and Queb&eacute;c.
                    If you are, or have been a resident of these provinces, legislation permits us to transfer or report unclaimed property to the appropriate authorities after a period of time.
                    If this is case, we may advise you to contact those authorities directly. This also applies to investments that are subject to federal regulation (such as a GIC), whereby we may refer you to the Bank of Canada.
