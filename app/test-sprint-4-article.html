But instead of making multiple resolutions that most of us never keep, what if we just decided to do one thing in 2017 to help make our world a better place? Surely one resolution is easier to keep than many.</p>
                <p class="body-copy">Figuring out what to do, though, can be a challenge – there are so many organizations that need help and so many ways to give back. Candice Lepage, a Guelph, Ontario-based communications professional, is already wondering how she’ll give back in the New Year. “My goal for this year has been to live more intentionally, and I realized that I haven’t been very intentional with my giving,” she says. “It’s something for me to think about for 2017.”</p>

                Ask yourself what kind of impact you want to have on people. Consider creating a “multi-plan,” where you’ll write down several things you care about and then narrow it down from there.
                </blockquote>
                <p class="body-copy">If you’re having trouble deciding on what cause or charity to concentrate on, there are ways to cut through the noise, says Paul Nazareth, vice-president, community engagement, at CanadaHelps, a site that describes itself as a one-stop shop for people and charities. Start by asking yourself what kind of impact you want to have on people. Consider creating a “multi-plan,” where you’ll write down several things you care about and then narrow it down from there, he says.</p>
                <p class="body-copy">Once you’ve decided on one or two causes to support, it’s time to do a little research. Nazareth suggests checking your charities’ overheads, including administration costs, salaries and how much money they spend to raise money. The information is usually available on a charity’s site or through the Canada Revenue Agency, and it can indicate how they’re using their donations. Most of the money should go to fulfilling the charity’s mandate.</p>
                <p class="body-copy">Also, consider calling and asking for a tour. This is a great opportunity to ask questions about how charities are meeting their goals, including what metrics they’re using and how they’re tracking them. Get as much reading material – such as annual reports – as you can, and read it all. Nazareth says people choose a charity with their emotions, but the final decision should be made with their heads.</p>
                <p class="body-copy">When you do decide on what cause to support in 2017, remember that it’s the start of a relationship and you should want that relationship to be a long one. Lepage is mulling her choices, but does hope to focus on two things: something personal, and something that helps the greater world. Her New Year’s resolution right now is to just start attending local meetings to see what’s out there and how she can contribute. “I want to start going to local events and learning,” she says. “Not saying anything, just listening and learning.”</p>

                    <div class="medium-6 columns">
                      It is. If you received, say, a five percent return on your $5,000 investment in 2009, you’d have earned $250. Now, if you have $31,000 invested, you’ll make $1,550. So people are starting to see some significant growth, and that encourages them to look at the TFSA as more of a long-term savings vehicle.

                      It’s around withdrawals. When you remove money from the account, you can’t add it back until the next year. For instance, if you take out $5,000 in 2013, you can only re-contribute that amount in January 2014. Make your withdrawals as late as you can in the year and you’ll get that room back very quickly.

                    </div>
                    <div class="medium-6 columns">
                      A lot of them should still be using the RRSP, because RRSP room is still higher than with the TFSA. Some high income earners generate nearly $24,000 a year in RRSP room. So there’s a big tax savings there. The rule of thumb is that if your marginal tax rate will be higher today than it will be in retirement, then you should use an RRSP. If someone is younger and their income isn’t that high, they might be better off to start contributing to their TFSA and then later, when their income rises, they can use that TFSA money to fund their RRSP.

                      Now that there’s more room to use, if someone is going to maximize their RRSP, which would generate a fairly significant tax savings, don’t go out and spend the refund. Invest it inside a TFSA and start accruing even more money tax-free. For people over 71 who don’t want to use the income from their Registered Retirement Income Fund but must receive the minimum payment, think about putting the after-tax RRIF proceeds into a TFSA. You’ve now converted taxable investment income into non-taxable income.

                      You can, but right now a lot of people still think of it as a short-term savings vehicle. That will change as people get older and have more money in their TFSA. People should be giving the same amount of consideration to the TFSA as they do their RRSP. Eventually we’ll have a situation where people will have hundreds of thousands of dollars in their TFSA, depending on how well they’ve done. We’re not there yet, but you can’t treat the TFSA as a lesser account.

                    There will always be nights when you have to squeeze in a bit of work, but trying to stick to a 9-to-5 or 8-to-4 day will help draw a line between your work and personal life. “That way you can separate things and make sure you’re not compensating on the weekend or at night,” Ciolfi says.

                    Avoid the temptation of doing housework or errands,” says Ciolfi. “If you make a habit of it, you’ll have trouble keeping consistent work hours.” That means putting down the vacuum cleaner and only going to the drugstore when the work is done, or when you’re on a break. Again, it’s about working during your own designated work hours to stay focused and separate the personal and business.

                    Step away from the desk and go for a walk or head to the gym. People who work from home forget how much movement can be involved in commuting to work, says Ciolfi. You’re burning way fewer calories walking from your bedroom to the kitchen to the office. ”It’s a hermit-like existence after a while,” says Ciolfi, “But it doesn’t have to be.”

                  <p class="body-copy-bold">Give It a Try</p>
                  <p>I was intrigued with the “25 Ways to Lead a Fuller Life” article, and then I was thrilled with some of the suggestions. I had written a “bucket list” a few years ago, and while I had crossed off some of the items, it needed updating. I now have some new things to add to my list, including seeing the polar bears in Churchill, viewing the northern lights, driving all of historic Route 66 and travelling to my family’s place of origin. I was going to add “go to a Stanley Cup final game,” but as a Leafs fan, well, maybe that belongs on a wish list.</p>

                  <p>“25 Ways to Lead a Fuller Life” was an excellent article, reminding me to not take life so seriously and to make time for life’s important things, not just the never-ending “to-do” lists! For that, I thank you!</p>

                  <p class="body-copy-bold">A Few More to Go</p>
                  <p>I retired from 30 years of teaching at the end of June, so your article “25 Ways to Lead a Fuller Life” got me curious to see if I have done any of the 25. Turns out I have completed five of the 25 things so far. Only 20 to go! I am planning to complete a couple in the next year. I have actually thought about doing many of these, and a few I had never thought of doing are quite intriguing. Hopefully, investing my retirement allowance with Investors Group will give me the opportunity to accomplish most of them.</p>
