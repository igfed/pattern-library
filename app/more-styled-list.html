                  <p class="body-copy-bold">Give It a Try</p>
                  <p>I was intrigued with the “25 Ways to Lead a Fuller Life” article, and then I was thrilled with some of the suggestions. I had written a “bucket list” a few years ago, and while I had crossed off some of the items, it needed updating. I now have some new things to add to my list, including seeing the polar bears in Churchill, viewing the northern lights, driving all of historic Route 66 and travelling to my family’s place of origin. I was going to add “go to a Stanley Cup final game,” but as a Leafs fan, well, maybe that belongs on a wish list.</p>

                  <p>“25 Ways to Lead a Fuller Life” was an excellent article, reminding me to not take life so seriously and to make time for life’s important things, not just the never-ending “to-do” lists! For that, I thank you!</p>

                  <p class="body-copy-bold">A Few More to Go</p>
                  <p>I retired from 30 years of teaching at the end of June, so your article “25 Ways to Lead a Fuller Life” got me curious to see if I have done any of the 25. Turns out I have completed five of the 25 things so far. Only 20 to go! I am planning to complete a couple in the next year. I have actually thought about doing many of these, and a few I had never thought of doing are quite intriguing. Hopefully, investing my retirement allowance with Investors Group will give me the opportunity to accomplish most of them.</p>
